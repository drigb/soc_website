Welcome to my website! I received my PhD from the sociology department at UNC-Chapel Hill and am currently a lecturer at Washington University in Saint Louis.. My research interests include racialization, immigration, politics, and population health. I am especially interested in how historical practices of racial social control provoke changes in local institutions that unfold across historical time into the development of contemporary place-based disparities. My ongoing projects connect historical violence to health disparities, for instance, by analyzing how historical practices of racial social control like sundown town practices restricting the mobility of Black people shaped local institutions in ways that entrenched structural racism, resulting in racially unequal exposure to the proximal determinants of health (e.g., air pollution and vulnerability to state violence). Here you can find information about my current research projects, teaching, and code for future projects.
