  In Fall 2020 I tought the undergrad Sociology of Politics course at UNC Chapel Hill. The students all conducted research for a final paper where they asked a research question about US politics. The students learned how to condust analyses in R. We posted their results and data visualizations to a course website so they could share their work.
