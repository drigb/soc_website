Capital punishment in the United States is a racialized form of social control: those convicted of the
murder of Whites are much more likely to receive the death penalty than those convicted for the murder
of Blacks. Capital punishment is most common in areas where the lynching of Blacks occurred more
frequently and in states which had legal slavery as of 1860. Accordingly, scholars have debated whether
capital punishment reflects a legacy of lynching or a legacy of slavery. We show that although capital
punishment is associated with county-level lynching, the association disappears when accounting for
county and state-level variation in the practice of slavery. Whether a county was in a state with legal
slavery as of 1860 predicts rates of both Black and White executions, suggesting that slaveryâ€™s state-level
institutional legacy is central to contemporary capital punishment."
